#Software Architecture Projects
## About this project
This repository contains the implementation of essays implemented for Software Architecture subject. The ideas and logic behind were developed by ourselves.
## System Requirements
- Python 3 or higher
- ast
- astor

## Useless Code Identifier
### About this Software
This program is used to identify unused methods in a Python 3 code. For the analysis is used the library "ast".
#### Usage
```bash
python3 Arvore.py
```

## LCOM4,n
### About this Software
This program calculates LCOM4 of a Python 3 code. Then, the number after the LCOM value represents the biggest connected component into the code. For this measurement it was used graphs and the "ast" library.
#### Usage
```bash
python3 Metrica.py
```

## Refactor Tool
### About this Software
This program analyzes the code looking for equal named methods in different classes. That, if it finds any, it is created a superclass with that method and the method itself from the classes is deleted
#### Usage
```bash
python3 Refatoracao.py
```
## Design Pattern Identifier
### About this Software
This program analyzes the python3 code and tries to find the following design patters into it: Decorator, Singleton and Facade.
#### Usage
```bash
python3 ReconhecedorPP.py
```

## Architectural Pattern Identifier
### About this Software
This program analyzes the python3 code and tries to find the following architectural patterns into it: MVP, MVC, Pipeline and Layers
#### Usage
```bash
python3 ReconhecedorCamadas.py
python3 ReconhecedorMVC.py
python3 reconheceMVP.py
python3 reconhecedorPipe.py
```
